      <p class=intro>I am driven to learn something everyday. I love to plan and and am good at working alongside people to turn their idea into a reality. I achieve this by using my own skills and organizing the efforts of a team to realize that goal. I take great satisfaction in being productive and busy with a desire to continually improve and expand my knowledge.</p>
