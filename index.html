<a id="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Welcome to GitHub Pages.</h3>

<p>This automatic page generator is the easiest way to create beautiful pages for all of your projects. Author your page content here using GitHub Flavored Markdown, select a template crafted by a designer, and publish. After your page is generated, you can check out the new branch:</p>

<pre><code>$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name
$ git fetch origin
$ git checkout gh-pages
</code></pre>

<p>If you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.</p>

<h3>
<a id="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Designer Templates</h3>

<p>We've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.</p>

<a id="rather-drive-stick" class="anchor" href="#rather-drive-stick" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Rather Drive Stick?</h3>

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>

<h3>
<a id="authors-and-contributors" class="anchor" href="#authors-and-contributors" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Authors and Contributors</h3>

<p>You can <a href="https://github.com/blog/821" class="user-mention">@mention</a> a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (<a href="https://github.com/defunkt" class="user-mention">@defunkt</a>), PJ Hyett (<a href="https://github.com/pjhyett" class="user-mention">@pjhyett</a>), and Tom Preston-Werner (<a href="https://github.com/mojombo" class="user-mention">@mojombo</a>) founded GitHub.</p>

<p>I am driven to learn more everyday. I love to plan and organize and I am good at working alongside people to turn their idea into a reality. I achieve this by using my own skills as well as optimizing the skills of a team to realize that goal. I have a strong work ethic and I take great satisfaction in being productive and busy with a desire to continually improve and expand my knowledge, and that is fun.</p>

<p>Work Experience:</p>

<p>Engineering Project Manager at Leeo
December 2013 - Present (1 year 2 months)</p>

<ul>
<li>When I began at this hardware startup company, there were a little more than a handful of people, and a vision for a new hardware product. There were some very preliminary prototypes and the dream to release that product to market within a year. I wore many hats during this process, and in the end I successfully defined and managed the development to production schedule and ensured the on-time delivery on our first hardware project! </li>
<li>I analyzed the critical path as well as set the milestones and managed the project schedule from prototyping development &amp; initial design concepts, to EVT, DVT, PVT and finally to mass production. I planed and monitored the project process to make sure features and schedule are preserved despite unexpected challenges of development and manufacturing in China.</li>
<li>I coordinated communication lines about timeline and milestones between software and hardware engineering internal teams to our OEMs engineering teams in Taiwan and the factory in China. I also managed the communication with many other stakeholders, mainly the contract designers for ID and packaging, feature product managers,  and component vendors. </li>
<li>I took six trips to Asia to go to the OEM’s head quarters and factories to make sure our product was being made to the correct spec, features, timeline, and quality control. I updated and held the documentation for the PRD (product requirements document) and QC (quality control) document to communicate our product on the manufacturing side.</li>
<li>I researched the safety compliance requirements, instructed design and facilitated certification of our product so it would comply with NRTL reqs (UL and ETL) and FCC, as well as researched for RoHS, CE, REACH, and other compliance requirements for consumer products for future market expansion. I worked with UL and Intertek in the US and Taiwan to get our product certified and ready to sell in the US and Canada market on time for the product launch.</li>
<li>I also act as a Software QA specialist for the App, device software, and web backend. I help develop testing procedures, plans for automation, and testing optimization. </li>
</ul>

<p>Prototyping Engineer and Engineering Project Lead at RoboteX Inc
January 2012 - December 2013 (2 years)</p>

<ul>
<li>Built robot prototypes. Worked with the principal mechanical design engineer, electrical/firmware engineers, and device software engineers to coordinate getting custom mechanical parts and circuit boards made, and built the prototypes. </li>
<li>Prepared the robotic design to go from R&amp;D to production with documentation, a BOM (bill of materials), assembly documentation SOPs (standard operation procedures), and sourcing information. </li>
<li>Coordinated work of 2 other robot engineers in the build and testing plan.</li>
<li>Planned and conducted engineering testing and research on robot design. Took design, made prototype parts, then built and tested robotic prototypes. Did initial QA and QC of design and bug finding. Made a plan, priority and schedule of building as well as bug fixing.</li>
<li>Managed the R&amp;D BOM, reviewed engineering drawings, and completed ECOs (engineering change orders) requested from production. Managed prototyping schedule of four new products.</li>
<li>Logistic sourcing EE and ME components and parts from 3rd party vendors for prototyping and production.</li>
